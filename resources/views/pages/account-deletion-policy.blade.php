                        <h5>1. Requesting Account Deletion</h5>
                        <p>
                            Users who wish to delete their account must submit a deletion request through their account
                            settings or by contacting our support team at <a
                                href="https://app.gocoompany.com/">app.gocoompany.com</a>.
                            Once the request is received, our team will process the deletion within the next 30 working
                            days.
                        </p>
                        <h5>2. Deletion Timeline</h5>
                        <p>
                            The account and all associated data will be permanently deleted within 30 working days from
                            the date of the request.
                            During this period, users will not have access to their account, and all services will be
                            suspended.
                        </p>
                        <h5>3. Data Retention</h5>
                        <p>
                            After the account is deleted, all personal data, including profile information, preferences,
                            and any content associated with the account, will be permanently removed from our systems.
                            Certain data may be retained in our backup systems for a limited time beyond the 30 working
                            days to comply with legal obligations or to resolve disputes.
                        </p>
                        <h5>4. Reversing Deletion Request</h5>
                        <p>
                            Once an account deletion request has been submitted, it cannot be reversed. The account and
                            its data will be permanently deleted after the 30 working days have passed.
                        </p>
